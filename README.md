# Foundry IQ deep dive

This repository combines a five-part Microsoft Foundry IQ notebook lab with one deployable
[Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/agent-framework/) HR agent. One `azd`
project provisions the shared Foundry project, `gpt-5.4` and `text-embedding-3-large` deployments,
Azure AI Search, storage, monitoring, and an optional F2 Fabric capacity. It then prepares Search
data, creates the agent's HR knowledge base and toolbox, and deploys the agent directly from Python
source.

## Architecture

```mermaid

  azd[azd up] --> foundry[Foundry project and models]
  azd --> search[Azure AI Search]
  azd --> fabric[Optional Fabric F2 capacity]
  search --> agentkb[zava-company-kb]
  agentkb --> toolbox[hr-agent-tools]
  toolbox --> agent[Hosted HR agent]
  search --> notebooks[Five notebook-created KBs]
  fabric --> notebooks
```

The examples intentionally remain independent. The notebooks create learning-path knowledge bases.
The hosted agent always uses its own `zava-company-kb` and `hr-agent-tools`; it does not depend on a
knowledge base created by a notebook.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription with permission to create resources and role assignments
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
  with the `azure.ai.agents` extension available
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and Python 3.12+
- Quota in one region for Foundry hosted agents, `gpt-5.4`, and `text-embedding-3-large`
- For notebook parts 3 and 5, a Fabric-capable tenant; the default deployment creates an F2 capacity
- For part 2, a `WEB_IQ_KEY` supplied by the Build lab organizer
- For parts 4 and 5, access to Microsoft 365 Work IQ data

## Provision and deploy

```bash
azd auth login
azd up
```

`azd up` provisions the resources, writes the generated local settings to `.env`, restores the
sample HR and health indexes, creates the independent HR agent knowledge base/toolbox, prepares
Fabric when enabled, and deploys `hr-agent`. No Azure resources are included in this repository.

Set `DEPLOY_FABRIC_CAPACITY=false` before `azd up` to use an existing Fabric workspace or skip the
Fabric portions. Set `FABRIC_WORKSPACE_ID` and `FABRIC_ONTOLOGY_ID` in `.env` before running parts 3
and 5 when you manage Fabric separately.

## Run the notebooks

Install the notebook kernel into the root environment:

```bash
uv sync --locked --all-groups
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r notebooks/requirements.txt
```

Add the externally supplied `WEB_IQ_KEY` to `.env` for part 2. Then open `notebooks/` in VS Code,
select `.venv/bin/python`, and run these in order:

1. `part1-standard-foundry-iq-kb.ipynb`
2. `part2-search-mcp-kb.ipynb`
3. `part3-fabric-iq-to-kb.ipynb`
4. `part4-work-iq-to-kb.ipynb`
5. `part5-work-iq-fabric-iq-to-kb.ipynb`

## Run and invoke the HR agent

Start the same hosted-agent source locally:

```bash
azd ai agent run
azd ai agent invoke --local "What benefits are available, and when do I need to enroll?"
```

Redeploy only the agent after code changes and invoke the deployed version:

```bash
azd deploy hr-agent
azd ai agent invoke hr-agent "What benefits are available, and when do I need to enroll?"
```

Direct source deployment is used because the final agent requires no custom OS packages. Foundry's
remote build resolves `src/hr-agent/pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, avoiding an unnecessary container
registry and image-build path.

## Validate locally

```bash
uv sync --locked --all-groups
uv run ruff check .
uv run python -m compileall -q infra scripts src/hr-agent
uv run python scripts/check_repo.py
az bicep build --file infra/main.bicep --stdout > /dev/null
azd show
```
